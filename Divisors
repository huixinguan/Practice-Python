Exercise 4 
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = [x for x in range(1,num+1) if num%x==0]
print(result)
