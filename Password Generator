Exercise 16
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.
Extra:
Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

solution:

def pw_generator():
    import string, random
    lowercase = string.ascii_lowercase
    uppercase = string.ascii_uppercase
    symbol = string.punctuation
    number = string.digits

    q = input("What type of password do you want to generate? Enter 'weak', 'strong'. ")
    if q[0] == 'w':
        password = random.sample(number, 5)
    elif q[0] == 's':
        password = random.sample(lowercase, 2)+ random.sample(uppercase,2)+ random.sample(symbol,2)+ random.sample(number,2)
        random.shuffle(password)
    else:
        print('Your entry is invalid, try again. Enter "weak" or "strong"')
    pw = "".join(password)
    print(pw)

pw_generator()
