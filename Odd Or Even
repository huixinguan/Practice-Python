Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0 and num % 4 == 0:
    print(num,'is an even number and a multiple of 4.')
elif num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, 'is an even number.')
else:
    print(num, 'is an odd number.')
print()
print()
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
check = int(input("Enter another number: "))
if num % check == 0:
    print(check, 'divides evenly into', num)
else:
    print(check, 'does NOT divides', num, 'evenly.')
