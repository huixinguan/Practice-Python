Exercise 1 
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
Extras:
Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

import datetime

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
year_100 = 100 - age + current_year
print(name + ' will turn 100 years old in year ' + str(year_100))
n = int(input("Enter a number for the above message to print out: "))
r = name + ' will turn 100 years old in year ' + str(year_100)
print(n * r)
print(n * (r+'\n'))
